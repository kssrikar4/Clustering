# Clustering Analysis of Biological Data

Welcome to the Clustering Analysis project! This repository focuses on the application of clustering techniques to publicly available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), showcasing advanced methodologies in bioinformatics and data visualization.

## Overview

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and cluster biological data sourced from NCBI datasets, providing insights into the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

### Data Source
- Datasets were randomly downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.

### Techniques Used
This project employs a variety of techniques to preprocess, visualize, and cluster biological data, including but not limited to:
- **Data Preprocessing and Filtering**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizing methods such as:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
- **Clustering Techniques**: Implementing various clustering algorithms, including:
  - K-means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
- **Data Visualization**: Creating informative visualizations to interpret clustering results and biological insights.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`) that detail the entire analysis process, including:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Dimensionality reduction techniques
- Clustering analysis using Scanpy
- Visualizations of clustering results

## Getting Started
To explore the project, clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including Scanpy, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kssrikar4/clustering-analysis.git
cd clustering-analysis
```

## Project Highlights
This project utilizes Scanpy, a powerful Python library for analyzing single-cell gene expression data, enabling the preprocessing, visualization, and clustering of high-dimensional biological datasets. It incorporates tools for normalization, dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, UMAP), and various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical, leiden) to identify distinct cell populations and explore gene expression patterns. The methodologies applied here are widely recognized in single-cell transcriptomics, facilitating cell type identification, developmental biology studies, and disease research by uncovering cellular heterogeneity and providing insights into biological processes.

By using these advanced techniques, this project not only highlights the capabilities of Scanpy but also demonstrates the potential for extracting meaningful biological insights from complex datasets. The visualizations generated throughout the analysis serve to enhance understanding and interpretation of the clustering results, making it easier to communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.
